## Partial Sums ##

A data structure that supports the following two operations:

1. *Init* that takes a list *A* of *n* elements
2. *Lookup* that takes two integers *0 &le i &lt j &le n* and returns
    the sum of all elements from *A[i]* to *A[j-1]*

The dynamic version includes a third operation *Set* that takes 
integer *i* and value *val* and sets *A[i]=val*
